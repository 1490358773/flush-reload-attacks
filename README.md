The code directly inside the `flush-reload` folder was provided by Yuval Yarom,
one of the authors of [FLUSH+RELOAD: a High Resolution, Low Noise, L3 Cache
Side-Channel Attack](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/448.pdf). The code inside
`flush-reload/myversion` is a complete re-write, based on the original code.
