Getting Started Guide
=====================

This guide will get you going with the attack code in this repository. It
assumes you're running Debian 8 Jessie, so if you're running a different variant
of Linux, you'll have to be smart and adapt the guide to work for you.

If you have run into any problems following this guide, please [open an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/defuse/flush-reload-attacks/issues).
