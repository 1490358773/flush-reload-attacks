Experiment Notes
-----------------
Date: Thu Jan  8 12:40:10 MST 2015

Testing after moving the binary locally.
This failed (probably) because TrueCrypt couldn't get admin rights with sudo.
I have to remember to run `sudo ls` before running the experiment and did not.

Actually, on later inspection, I don't think it was that, since I added a sudo
echo to the experiment.sh and it didn't prompt me for a password but because
volumes were already mounted.
