Schedule
========

This is a rough outline of the expected progress for each month. Note that each
month corresponds to at least 20 hours of focused work. Avoid assuming any more
hours than that. The bullet points for each month should be taken to be the
*minimum*. If they are not all complete at the end of the month, I am behind
schedule.

September
------------

- Catch up on side channel literature (8 hours).
- Create a bibliography of relevant research (2 hours).
- Reproduce the original FLUSH+RELOAD attack against GPG (10 hours).

October
------------

- Reproduce another side channel that seems relevant to the project idea (8
  hours).
- Write the paper structure (2 hours).
- Brainstorming, find applications to target (5 hours).
- Review application list brainstorm and select best targets (5 hours).

November
------------

- Target application #1 (10 hours).
- Target application #2 (10 hours).

December
------------

- Target application #3 (10 hours).
- Write paper with results to a publishable quality.

January
------------

- TBA: Fill in the next months as brainstorming progresses. These will probably
  be filled with defense-related stuff, like making something that transforms
  C code to be resistant to FLUSH+RELOAD, or something.

February

March

April
